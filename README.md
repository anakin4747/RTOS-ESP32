# RTOS-ESP32
RTOS concepts on an ESP32

Following along the tutorials at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBQazB0HUyQ4hAPU1cJED6t3DU0h34bz to learn RTOS concepts such as Semaphores, mutexs, race conditions, IPC, Deadlocks, priority inversion, priority inhereitance and more.

The tutorial I followed was in the Arduino Development Environment but I wanted
to use the Espressif IDF instead to learn the toolchain and program in C.
